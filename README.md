 Introduction

**Project Overview**
The Tank game is an ideal term project because it entails both designing and implementing a fascinating game from start to finish.. The main goal of the game is to achieve fast, challenging gameplay for two players where both of them control tanks and the field is full of barriers. This project also provides real-world ideas related to object-oriented programming and game development as well as resource optimization and use of libraries. It is a focal point of competitive play where the two players are engaged in an ongoing fight.
Introduction of the Tank Game
The Tank game is a 2D arcade shooting game in which players can enjoy the real intense battle experience. Players control a tank, moving it across a map and fighting against the opposite tank. The goal is to fire at the enemy tank and do not allow them to shoot back at you. The game ends once either tank loses their lives completely. Through this mechanism, gameplay remains stimulating and rewarding for the player in the process of completing a level.
